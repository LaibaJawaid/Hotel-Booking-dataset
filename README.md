# Hotel Booking Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to practice advanced sampling techniques, specifically focusing on stratified sampling instead of simple random splitting. The goal is to ensure representative sampling across important booking categories.

## Objectives Achieved

## 1. Data Stratification
Applied stratified sampling to maintain proportional representation

Stratified based on:
Hotel type (City Hotel vs Resort Hotel)
Booking status (Canceled vs Not Canceled)
Customer type (Transient, Contract, Group, Transient-Party)
Market segment

## 2. Room Preference Analysis

Categorized bookings by desired room type
Analyzed room type preferences across different customer segments
Created visualizations comparing room preferences before and after stratification

## 3. Visualizations Created

- Before Stratification:
- 
### Original distribution analysis
- Room type distribution bar chart
- Cancellation rate by hotel type
- Market segment composition pie chart

- After Stratification:

### Stratified sample analysis  
- Comparative bar charts (before vs after)
- Room preference heatmaps
- Customer type distribution comparison
